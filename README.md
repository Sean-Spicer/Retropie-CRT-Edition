| For Raspberry 2B/3B/3A+/3B+ | Released November 9, 2020 [[Changelog](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Changelog)]| 

Adding support to Retropie for custom 15khz resolutions and some cool utilities like USB Automount or easy TATE mode changing.

This software works with some VGA666 based adapters, check compatibility [HERE](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Adaptadores-RGB)

Maybe some professional monitors like SONY PVM, BVM or DTV could face some resolution problems, most of TV or monitors seems to work great with super-resolutions.

Special [thanks](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Thanks-to) to all who have participated on this proyect.

**_'On the fly' resolutions system change_** based on the work of **Sir-Ironic** ['RPi-Hdmi_Timings' GITHUB](https://github.com/Sir-Ironic/RPi-Hdmi_Timings)
