| Current Version | EVO | FINAL 1.0 | Retropie 4.5 | RPi 2B/3B/3A+/3B+ | [Changelog](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Changelog)  |

Adding support to Retropie for custom 15khz resolutions and some cool utilities like USB Automount or easy TATE mode changing.

This software works with some VGA666 based adapters, check compatibility [HERE](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Adaptadores-RGB)

Maybe some professional monitors like SONY PVM, BVM or DTV could face some resolution problems, most of TV or monitors seems to work great with super-resolutions.

**_'On the fly' resolutions system change_** based on the work of **Sir-Ironic** ['RPi-Hdmi_Timings' GITHUB](https://github.com/Sir-Ironic/RPi-Hdmi_Timings)

_Please take a look to our [Wiki](https://github.com/krahsdevil/crt-for-retropie/wiki) (in progress)._
